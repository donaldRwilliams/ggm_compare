This repo contains all the code to reproduce the simulations provided in the paper, "Comparing Gaussian Graphical Models with the Posterior Predictive
Distribution and Bayesian Model Selection."

Note that there is also a package that implements the methods. However, to ensure the code does not break, say, if the package is changed, 
functions are provided instead of using the package.
